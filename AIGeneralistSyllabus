GENERAL LEARNING TIPS FOR THE 12-MONTH JOURNEY:

- Consistency is Key: Regular, focused effort is far more effective than sporadic cramming.
- Embrace Errors: Errors are part of coding. Learn to read them, search for them, and debug.
- Learn Actively: Don't just watch videos. Pause, re-type the code, experiment, change parameters, see what happens.
- Build a Portfolio: Start a GitHub repository from day one. Every small script, every project, no matter how simple, goes there. This is your professional resume.
- Explain Concepts Aloud: Try to explain what you've learned to someone else (or even just to yourself/a rubber duck). This helps solidify understanding.
- Network: Join online communities (Reddit's r/learnpython, r/MachineLearning, r/datascience, Discord servers), attend virtual meetups.
- Stay Curious: AI is a vast and rapidly evolving field. Always be open to learning new things.
